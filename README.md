I am a Senior Scrum Master and Project Manager with over 8 years of experience delivering complex initiatives in banking, fintech, and government environments.

My expertise lies in leading cross-functional teams, managing end-to-end delivery, and aligning business, technology, and stakeholders to achieve predictable outcomes. I have worked extensively in regulated environments, coordinating internal teams and external vendors while ensuring quality, transparency, and delivery discipline.

This portfolio highlights real-world case studies, Agile delivery practices, metrics-driven insights, and frameworks I actively use in my day-to-day work. My focus is not just on applying Agile frameworks, but on making delivery work in complex, real-life conditions.
